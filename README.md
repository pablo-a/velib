# Paris Velib's (new bike sharing system) real time visualisation

Paris has a new bike sharing system since early 2018. We gather data from its public API to be able to visualize it.

This software contains utility for :
- fetching real time velib data from their API (Python)
- A Web server that synchronize the front with new data.
- displaying it in real time with google maps & heatmap layers (HTML, CSS, JS)
